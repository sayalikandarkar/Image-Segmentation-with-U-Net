# Image-Segmentation-with-U-Net

## U-Net is a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, used to predict a label for every single pixel in an image; for example in case of an image from a self-driving car dataset. 

## This type of image classification is called semantic image segmentation. It's similar to object detection but where object detection labels objects with bounding boxes that may include pixels that aren't part of the object, semantic image segmentation allows you to predict a precise mask for each object in the image by labeling each pixel in the image with its corresponding class.

### Dataset used - CARLA self-driving car dataset

### The code has been provided in the python file uploaded; just execute it step by step on a jupyter notebook
